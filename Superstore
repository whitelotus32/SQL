# Superstore Data Analysis

## Objective
This project aims to analyze the Superstore dataset to gain insights into product pricing, stock management, customer satisfaction, and category performance.

## Dataset Description
The dataset consists of information about various items sold in a superstore, including item ID, name, category, price, stock quantity, and average rating.

## Key Questions
1. Which category has the highest average price?
2. What is the relationship between item price and average rating?
3. Which items are running low in stock relative to their price?
4. Are there any categories where items have a high price but low average rating?
5. How does the average rating vary across different price ranges?

## Approach
1. Calculate the average price for each category and identify the category with the highest average price.
2. Examine the relationship between item price and average rating by analyzing the data and visualizing any trends or patterns.
3. Determine which items have a low stock quantity relative to their price by calculating a stock-to-price ratio.
4. Identify categories where items have a high price but low average rating by comparing average prices and ratings within each category.
5. Divide items into price ranges (low, medium, high) and analyze how average ratings vary across these price ranges.

## Tools Used
- SQL for querying the dataset

## Outcome
The project will provide insights into pricing strategies, inventory management, customer satisfaction levels, and category performance, enabling data-driven decision-making to optimize sales and enhance customer experience in the superstore.

### This project utilizes the following Superstore data: 

CREATE TABLE superstore (
    item_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    item_name TEXT,
    category TEXT,
    price DECIMAL(10, 2),
    stock_quantity INTEGER,
    average_rating DECIMAL(3, 2)
);

INSERT INTO superstore (item_id, item_name, category, price, stock_quantity, average_rating)
VALUES
    (1, 'Stainless Steel Cookware Set', 'Kitchen Supplies', 89.99, 50, 4.6),
    (2, 'Memory Foam Mattress', 'Furnishings', 499.99, 30, 4.8),
    (3, 'Smart LED TV', 'Electronics', 549.00, 20, 4.5),
    (4, 'Robot Vacuum Cleaner', 'Appliances', 199.50, 40, 4.3),
    (5, 'Wireless Bluetooth Speaker', 'Electronics', 39.99, 60, 4.2),
    (6, 'Non-Stick Baking Set', 'Kitchen Supplies', 29.95, 80, 4.4),
    (7, 'Cotton Bedding Set', 'Furnishings', 89.00, 25, 4.7),
    (8, 'Smart Home Security Camera', 'Electronics', 79.95, 15, 4.1),
    (9, 'Air Purifier', 'Appliances', 129.50, 35, 4.6),
    (10, 'Premium Coffee Maker', 'Kitchen Supplies', 79.99, 50, 4.9),
    (11, 'Ergonomic Office Chair', 'Furnishings', 189.00, 20, 4.5),
    (12, 'Wireless Earbuds', 'Electronics', 49.99, 75, 4.3),
    (13, 'Slow Cooker', 'Appliances', 49.95, 30, 4.7),
    (14, 'Cutlery Set', 'Kitchen Supplies', 34.50, 40, 4.4),
    (15, 'Cozy Throw Blanket', 'Furnishings', 24.99, 100, 4.2);


## Use a SELECT statement to order the items by price.
SELECT item_name, price
FROM superstore
ORDER BY price desc;

## Show a statistic about the item prices.
SELECT avg(price)
FROM superstore;

## Show a statistic about the price for items in the category of "Kitchen Supplies". 
SELECT avg(price)
FROM superstore
WHERE category="Kitchen Supplies"

## Which category has the highest average price?
<!--- Calculating the average price for each category and identifying which category has the highest average price. -->
SELECT category, AVG(price) AS average_price
FROM superstore
GROUP BY category
ORDER BY average_price DESC
LIMIT 1;

## What is the relationship between item price and average rating?
<!--- By analyzing the correlation between item price and average rating, I determined if there's any relationship between these two variables. Are higher-priced items typically rated higher? -->
SELECT item_name, price, average_rating
FROM superstore
ORDER BY price;

## Which items are running low in stock relative to their price?
<!--- Calculating a ratio of stock quantity to price for each item and identifying which items have a relatively low stock quantity compared to their price. This can help in identifying potential inventory management issues. -->
SELECT item_name, price, stock_quantity, (stock_quantity / price) AS stock_price_ratio
FROM superstore
ORDER BY stock_price_ratio ASC;

## Are there any categories where items have a high price but low average rating?
<!--- By examining the relationship between price and average rating within each category, I was able to identify categories where items are priced high but have relatively low average ratings. This could indicate areas for potential improvement or market shifts. -->
SELECT category, AVG(price) AS average_price, AVG(average_rating) AS average_rating
FROM superstore
GROUP BY category
HAVING average_price > 100 AND average_rating < 4.5;

## How does the average rating vary across different price ranges?
<!--- By dividing the items into price ranges (e.g., low, medium, high) and calculating the average rating within each range, I can explore how the average rating varies as prices increase or decrease. This analysis can provide insights into customer preferences at different price points. -->
SELECT 
    CASE 
        WHEN price <= 50 THEN 'Low'
        WHEN price > 50 AND price <= 100 THEN 'Medium'
        WHEN price > 100 THEN 'High'
    END AS price_range,
    AVG(average_rating) AS average_rating
FROM superstore
GROUP BY price_range;
